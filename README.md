# Analog clock using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

There must be effect of minute and second hand on hour hand(Cause deflection)
We are going to neglect effect of second hand on both hour hand and minute hand .

For hour hand
12 hr = 360 deg
1 hr = 360/12 deg ;
1 hr = 30deg ;
for h hours
h = 30h deg ;

Effect of minute hand
60 min = 30deg ;
1 min = 1/2 deg ;
for m minutes
m = m/2 deg ;

total rotation = 30h + m/2 deg;

//-----------------------------------------------------------
For minute hand
60 min = 360 deg ;
1 min = 6 deg ;
for m minutes
m = 6m deg ;
total rotation = 6m deg;
//----------------------------------------------

For second hand
60s = 360 deg ;
1 s = 6 deg ;
for s minutes
s = 6s deg ;
total rotation = 6s deg;
